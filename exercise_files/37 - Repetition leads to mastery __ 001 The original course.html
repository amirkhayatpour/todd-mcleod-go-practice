<p>Everything from this point forward is the ORIGINAL&nbsp;COURSE. </p><p>I have created this course twice. </p><p>The course you just went through is <strong>the new course. </strong>I&nbsp;created the new course to have more hands-on exercise. </p><p>The course that follows here is <strong>the original course.</strong> If you want to go through this original course, you will reinforce what you have learned. You will also gain new perspectives as I cover some aspects in a slightly different way. I also cover some things in this original course which were not covered in the course you just completed. </p><p><strong><em>I'm leaving this course here as many students have enjoyed and benefitted from this material.</em></strong></p>
