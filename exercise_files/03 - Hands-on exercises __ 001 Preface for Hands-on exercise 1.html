<p>In the next video, we will do a hands-on exercise together. In the video, you will see me completing this hands-on exercise in VS Code, which is a program from Microsoft for writing code (officially it's called an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), but that phrase sounds overly complicated to me). THE IMPORTANT INFORMATION I WANT TO CONVEY: all of the coding you see me do in the next exercise, please do your coding at the golang playground which you can find by Googling "Golang playground" or by clicking here:</p><p><a href="https://go.dev/play/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://go.dev/play/</a></p><p>The link will also be provided as a RESOURCE&nbsp;link associated with this lecture.</p><p>Further into the course, you will learn all of the details necessary to get packages set up and work with and IDE.</p>
