<p><strong><em>These are presentations I've used to talk about Go. </em></strong><em>Some of them provide talking points. Some of them provide code snippets. A lot of them have exercises which are fun to explore. There's also a nice document in here that compares Javascript with Go. Peruse these documents as you like but don't spend too much time here. </em><strong><em>Continue progressing with the course, and know that these documents are here if you ever want to come back and look at them.</em></strong></p>
